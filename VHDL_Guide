### VHDL Basics
```

full adder - carry input to the function - allows for multibit operations
half adder - carry output

Moore Machine vs Mealy Machine (both FSM):

Moore Output - every state depends on the previous one
Mealy Output - depends on previous state and external input.

### Commands

use - import (like for libraries)
ie: use ieee.stdlogic.all

### Structure
```
Entity vs Architecture: Entity describes the interface of a design, whereas Architecture describes the functionality.
